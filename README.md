# @platformatic/rabbitmq-hooks

Wrap RabbitMQ inside your application easily.
This assumes that you have a RabbitMQ server running, and the exchanges are already setup.

Then you can:
- Export the messages published on an exchange to a HTTP endpoint with `POST` method.
- Publish messages to an exchange from a HTTP endpoint with a `POST` on `/publish` endpoint


## Standalone Install & Test

You can generate a standalone application with: 

```bash
npx --package @platformatic/rabbitmq-hooks -c create-platformatic-rabbitmq-hooks
cd rabbitmq-hooks-app
```

This application assumes that you have a RabbitMQ server running at `amqp://localhost`. A `my-exchange` exchange is created if not present.
Now start a RabbitMQ server if not already running, for instance with docker:

```bash
docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name plt-rabbit rabbitmq:3

```

Then you can run the application with `npm start`:

```bash
âžœ npm start

> start
> platformatic start

[14:10:25.128] INFO (main/91344): Starting rabbitmq-hooks plugin
[14:10:25.197] INFO (main/91344): Connected to RabbitMQ
[14:10:25.198] INFO (main/91344): Listening to exchange my-exchange
[14:10:25.199] INFO (main/91344): No routing key specified

[14:10:25.255] INFO (main/91344): Server listening at http://0.0.0.0:3042
```

To test this, you can add a `out` endpoint to the app, e.g. in `routes/root` add:

```javascript
  fastify.post('/out', async (request, reply) => {
    const message = await request.body.message
    console.log('RECEIVED MESSAGE FROM RABBITMQ')
    console.log(message)
  })
```

Then change `.env` to use it:

```bash
PLT_SERVER_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
PLT_SERVER_LOGGER_LEVEL=info
PORT=3042
PLT_TYPESCRIPT=false
PLT_RABBITMQ_CONNECTION_URL=amqp://localhost
PLT_RABBITMQ_GENERATE_EXCHANGE=true
PLT_RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE_NAME_0=my-exchange
PLT_RABBITMQ_TARGET_URL_0=http://localhost:3042/out
```

And restart the application. Now you can test the application with:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"exchange": "my-exchange","message": "Hello World"}' http://localhost:3042/publish
```

The message is first posted on the exchange, and then the application will post it to the `out` endpoint:

```bash
